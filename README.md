# react-metronome

A Metronome app that interpolates two audio beats and changes tempo based on the value of the Beats Per Measure(BPM).

A metronome is a practice tool that produces a steady pulse (or beat) to help musicians play rhythms accurately. 

The pulses are measured in beats-per-minute (BPM). This metronomes are capable of playing beats from 60 to 240 BPM.
